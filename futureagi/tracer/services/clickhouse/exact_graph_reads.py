"""Exact current-state aggregation reads for public Observe graphs.

ClickHouse 25.3 cannot share a snapshot across separately executed statements,
and a version predicate on ``ReplacingMergeTree`` is not time travel after a
background merge. Most aggregate readers therefore use one full-window
statement. Filtered trace graphs use finite identity batches; filtered span
graphs scan adjacent whole-hour ranges because ``toStartOfHour(start_time)`` is
part of the table's replacement identity. A late arrival or background merge
between statements can affect a refresh, so neither sequence is advertised as
MVCC. Both freeze the requested window and any PostgreSQL-resolved membership
once, prevent duplicate contribution, and fail before publication if any
required read fails. Only a complete result may replace the prior snapshot in
``exact_aggregation_cache``.
